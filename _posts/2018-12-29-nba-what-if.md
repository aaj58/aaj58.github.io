What if the NBA standings were scored like the NHL? As a review, the NHL creates its standings as follows: 
- A team receives two standings points for winning in regulation
- If a team loses in regulation, they receive no standings points.
- If a game goes into overtime, both teams get a point. 
  - The team that wins in OT gets two points total, and the losing team walks away with just the one.
  
Then, based on these scores the playoff picture is decided. The playoffs in the NHL are constructed by selecting the top three teams in each division and then the next two teams in the conference come in as wild cards. 

The NHL is a little bit different because there are only two divisions per conference compared to the NBA's three. So let's mess around and pretend that in this alternative universe, the top two teams in each division automatically make the playoffs. Then the next two teams in the conference come in. 

This means the following playoff breakdown: 

**East:**
- 2 Atlantic division teams 
- 2 Southeastern division teams 
- 2 Central division teams 
- Next top 2 teams in the Eastern Confernece 

**West:**
- 2 Southwestern division teams 
- 2 Pacific division teams 
- 2 Northwest division teams 
- Next top 2 teams in the Western Conference

To get this sorted out, I looked at the 2017-2018 NBA season and reimagined the standings based on the NHL scoring criteria. Now, the NHL scoring works well for hockey (maybe) due to the nature of how goals are scored. As [I've explored before](https://ashleyajohn.github.io/2018/04/03/hockey-shots.html), it is pretty hard to score a game in the NHL. In basketball however, scoring points are not as difficult. In NHL, it is of interest to teams who are tied close to the end of regulation to hold out for a "loser's point." In these scenarios, teams are trying not to lose rather than trying to win. Per [Hockey Reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2018_games.html), 23.29% of regular reason NHL games went into overtime. Per [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_games.html), only 4.96% of regular season NBA games went into OT. So it is difficult to imagine what rewarding OT might look like in basketball. Would the last quarter of close NBA games become even more mindnumbing, trying to draw fouls for every little thing? Or would teams stop trying to draw fouls to keep the scoring close? Who knows. Just wanted to put a disclaimer out that this scoring method doesn't *perfectly* map onto basketball. But that's what makes it fun! 

Okay, so I went back through the schedule and used data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_games.html) to retroactively remake the standings. Games that were won in regulation gave two points to the winning team and none to the losing team. Games that went into OT (no matter how many periods of it) gave two points to the winner and one point to the loser. 

Now, I took a closer look at what the playoff situation might look like under the NHL framework. Under this new system, the Eastern Conference playoffs look like this (divisonal spots in green, wildcard spots in yellow): 

**East**

The same exact teams in the East make it into the playoffs, but in a bit of a different order. The West?

In this world, the Clippers make the playoffs soundly and the Nuggets squeeze their way in at the expense of the Timberwolves and the Spurs. Interesting!

Now, we start to suspend belief. Let's pretend that once the teams are set, they are reseeded within their conference. Meaning that the division matters to get into the playoffs, but no longer matters once the playoffs start. Then, the seeding would look as follows:

**East:** 
![eastern_conference_seeding]({{ "/assets/eastern_conference_seeding.PNG" | absolute_url }})

Which, boringly enough, ends up being exactly what happened in the East. Fine! What about the West?

**West:** 
![western_conference_seeding]({{ "/assets/western_conference_seeding.PNG" | absolute_url }})


Note: Thunder end up on top of Jazz because they won the divisonal regular season matchups 3-1. Now in this scenario, a brand new first round: 

- Rockets (1) vs. Clippers (8)
- Warriors (2) vs. Nuggets (7)
- Blazers (3) vs. Jazz (6)
- Pelicans (4) vs. Thunder (5) 

What might the playoff picture looked like in this case? I'd still bet on the Warriors taking it all, but a first round exit for the Blazers might not have been a reality and the Thunder might have taken the Pelicans down a notch (lowering our expectations for this year perhaps...). On the contrary, a Clippers/Rockets first round would have been either hilarious or incredibly boring. 

And just for fun, what would a playoff structure that didn't even care about conferences look like? Something like this: 

![league_seeding]({{ "/assets/league_seeding.PNG" | absolute_url }})

The Spurs and Timberwolves squeeze their ways in there at the expense of the Clippers and the Wizards. 

The basketball is different from hockey is almost every way, so though this scoring format doesn't make much intuitive sense, this analysis was a fun thought experiment about how the playoffs might look and how it would result regular season play as a result. Glad to see the Sixers make their way in regardless :)
