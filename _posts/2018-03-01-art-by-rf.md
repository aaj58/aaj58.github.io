title: "Painting with Pixels: Random Forests for Image Approximation"
date: 2018-03-01

Last semester at Cornell Tech, I took a [machine learning course](https://cornelltech.github.io/cs5785-fall-2017/index.html) that was an incredible foundation of ML tools using python. One of our assignments used random forests for image approximation. The goal of the analysis was to approximate an entire image based on random samples of pixels. Essentially, the algorithm would sample some small percentage of pixels from an image. These samples would be fed into a random forest algorithm which would then use the sample image to approximate the rest of the pixels in the image. The sample image we were given was the Mona Lisa, and our algorithms ended up essentially “painting” the remainder of the image. 
I was so intrigued by this assignment and the cool things that machine learning could do that I decided to apply the algorithm to more pieces of art work. I’ve created an [Instagram account (@artbyrandomforests)](https://instagram.com/artbyrandomforests) to share some of the outputs—always looking for more suggestions too! 

Below are a few sample outputs with their model parameters. [Code for this project can be found on my Github.](https://github.com/ashleyajohn/hockeyData)
