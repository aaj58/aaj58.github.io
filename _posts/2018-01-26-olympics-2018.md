The Winter Olympics begin in less than two weeks at Pyeongchang! As sad as I am that I won't be seeing NHL players on the world's greatest stage, the 2018 Winter Olympics are set to be impressive. To appreciate it on a deeper level, I took a look at the historical medal data from The Guardian to see how past games have played out. As even a basic spectator would tell you, some counties tend to be Olympic powerhouses - and the data clearly reflected it! As a former Industrial Engineering student, I was stuck with a memory from sophomore year of my professor lecturing us about the Pareto Principle. The basic idea behind the Pareto Principle is that 80% of the work is done by 20% of the actions. The principle has endless implications, but I was curious to see if it held up for Olympic medal winners. So I set out to answer the question: are 80% of olympic medals from 20% of the countries competing? 

Well, to start off I looked at just the countries competing for both the Winter and Summer Olympics from 1896-2016. 

For the Winter games, of the 45 unique countries that have participated over the last 120 years, 80% of the medals come from 13 countries. That is, 80% of the medals come from roughly 29% of the countries. Check out the the breakdown of the top 80% in the chart below. Pareto Principle: BUSTED for this one!

Next, let's check out the same idea for the Summer games. Of the 152 countries that participated in the Summer Games, 80% of the medals comes from just 25 countries. That translates to 80% of the medals coming from only 16% of the countries! Pareto Principle is again BUSTED!

Now, this is nice, but what does it mean? For the Winter games which have less than 1/3 of the countries participating compared to the Summer games, the medal winner is a bit more spread out. Or, there is slightly less of a dominance of one single country as compared to the Summer games. 

So where do these dominating countries come from and what sports are they dominant in? That is the next question to be answered! I created the same charts as before but broke it down a but further based on Country and Sport. 

For this data set, a there are a total of 140 Country-Sport pairs. Of these 140, 80% of the medals are won by 30% of the Country-Sport pairs. As one would expect, Canadian Ice Hockey takes the number one spot. Pareto Principle is again BUSTED!

Checking out the same thing for the Summer games: of the 1142 (wow!) Country-Sport pairs, 80% of the medals are won by 25% of the countries. Here though, the numbers are a bit more interesting. After the amazingly dominant USA Men's Swimming, the medals get far more spread out. Check out the long tail for this one! It takes a whooping 287 Country-Medal pairs to hit that 80% cumulative total. Pareto Principle: BUSTED in this marathon!

Finally, I took a look at the gender breakdowns. What does the Country-Gender spread look like? Well, at the Winter Games, there were a total of 84 Country-Gender pairs. From that, 80% of the medals were won by 29% of the Country-Gender pairs with American men leading the way. Pareto Principle: BUSTED!

In the summer, of the 245 Country-Gender pairs, 80% of the medals were won by just 17% of the Country-Gender pairs. American Men again splash away all competition.

In all cases, the Pareto Principle was busted. In some cases, like for the Country-Sport pairings, it meant that the medal spread was a bit more distributed. In other words, medals were won by a more diverse group. However, in other pairs like Country-Gender in the Summer games, a few groups dominate the medal winnings. 

As an American and a lover of sports, I can say wholeheartedly that I hope this winter's 2018 games show a diverse pool of talent where athletes from every country and gender can compete and showcase their talent. Let the games begin!
